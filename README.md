# License Convention Metadata

- **UUID**: b77365e5-2b0c-4141-b917-c03b7c68e935
- **Name**: License
- **Schema URL**: "<https://raw.githubusercontent.com/clbarnes/zarr-convention-license/refs/tags/v1/schema.json>"
- **Spec URL**: "<https://github.com/clbarnes/zarr-convention-license/blob/v1/README.md>"
- **Scope**: Array, Group
- **Extension Maturity Classification**: Proposal
- **Owner**: @clbarnes

## Description

This convention defines how to communicate the license(s) of the data contained in a Zarr group or array.
The license metadata exists in a field called `license` at the root `attributes` level following the [Zarr Conventions Specification](https://github.com/zarr-conventions/zarr-conventions-spec).

Communicating the license of data is applicable across ecosystems and applications,
and should be made as low-friction as possible to facilitate re-use of FAIR data.

If applied to a group, a license implicitly applies to all descendants of that group.
It is the responsibility of entities sharing subsets of Zarr data (or links to it) that the license is accessible from the shared subset.
If license metadata is defined in a descendant of a group with license metadata, it is considered to override the ancestor's:
i.e. if the descendant license metadata should instead be additive, the ancestor license must be re-applied.

- Examples:
  - **RECOMMENDED**: [SPDX specifier](examples/spdx.json)
  - [URL to license text](examples/url.json)
  - [License text](examples/text.json)
  - [File containing license text](examples/file.json)
  - [Path to Zarr node with license metadata](examples/path.json)

## Motivation

- **Data sharing**: Zarr data is regularly shared as a URL to a remote store; the license should be accessible alongside the data
- **Machine-discoverability**: Increasingly, data is accessed by automated systems, which should be able to parse standard licenses in situ
- **Use case alignment**: Various wrapper formats and sub-conventions may include license information, but these may not be understood by all zarr-reading tools

## Convention Registration

The convention must be registered in `zarr_conventions`:

```json
{
  "zarr_conventions": [
    {
      "schema_url": "https://raw.githubusercontent.com/clbarnes/zarr-convention-license/refs/tags/v1/schema.json",
      "spec_url": "https://github.com/clbarnes/zarr-convention-license/blob/v1/README.md",
      "uuid": "b77365e5-2b0c-4141-b917-c03b7c68e935",
      "name": "license",
      "description": "License specifier for Zarr data"
    }
  ]
}
```

## Applicable To

This convention can be used with these parts of the Zarr hierarchy:

- [x] Group
- [x] Array

## Properties

The `license` key at the root `attributes` level MUST be an object.
The object SHOULD only have one key, although multiple MAY be given if they represent identical licenses;
i.e. do not use the "MIT" SPDX identifier and a URL to an Apache license.
Implementations MAY ignore additional keys when resolving the license,
but SHOULD retain the original multiple representations when writing back.

An empty `license` array represents unlicensed data which SHOULD NOT be accessed without permission.

**Convention metadata name**: `license`

| Field Name | Type                              | Description  |
| ---------- | --------------------------------- | ------------ |
| license    | [License Object](#license-object) | **REQUIRED** |

**Example**:

```json
{
  "attributes": {
    "zarr_conventions": [
      { "name": "license", "uuid": "b77365e5-2b0c-4141-b917-c03b7c68e935" }
    ],
    "license": { "spdx": "CC0" }
  }
}
```

### License Object

At least one field MUST be used.
Only one field SHOULD be used.
The `spdx` form is RECOMMENDED.

Where multiple fields are given, implementations SHOULD prefer fields at the top of the list to fields at the bottom,
and MAY treat subsequent fields as redundant.

| Field Name | Type   | Description                                                                          |
| ---------- | ------ | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------ |
| spdx       | string | **RECOMMENDED**. An [SPDX license expression](https://spdx.org/licenses/).           |
| url        | string | A URL to the full text of the license.                                               |
| text       | string | The full JSON-encoded text of the license.                                           |
| file       | string | A relative path from this Zarr node to an object containing the text of the license. |
| path       | string | A relative path from this Zarr node to a Zarr node with explicit license metadata.   |

Some licenses require further information for attribution purposes.
Such attribution information is out of scope for this convention.

SPDX expressions support arbitrary combinations of licenses with `AND`, `OR`, parentheses `()`, and `WITH` exceptions.
Other forms representing similar combinations MUST contain all relevant license and exception texts.

Data which explicitly grants no license SHOULD use `"license": {"spdx": "NONE"}`.

### Additional Field Information

#### `"url"` (`license.url`)

Where possible, this should use the HTTPS scheme.
The endpoint should return plain text in response to a standard GET request, ideally with no or minimal markup.

For common licenses, multiple URLs may resolve to identical license text.
It is RECOMMENDED to use "more canonical" sources (e.g. an apache license from the apache domain).

#### `"file"` (`license.file`)

Paths are relative to the Zarr node (i.e. the prefix/ "directory" containing the metadata file), using POSIX semantics.
Ancestor prefixes MAY be traversed with `..`.
The current prefix MAY be referred to as `.`.
The path MAY start with `./`.
The path MUST NOT start or end with `/`.

The file containing the license text MUST be UTF-8 encoded and SHOULD contain minimal markup.

**WARNING**: Rootward references (`..`) can fail if the store uses a root which is a descendant of the highest-level element in the path.
Implementations SHOULD treat the data as unlicensed if the reference cannot be resolved to valid license metadata.

**WARNING**: Rootward references (`..`) can return misleading information if any indirection takes place in the hierarchy (e.g. file system mounts or symlinks).

#### `"path"` (`license.path`)

The rules around resolving relative paths is as described in the `file` section above, with the same warnings.

While `file` resolves to a stored object, `path` should resolve to a prefix representing a zarr node (group or array).
i.e. the metadata document for the node would be retrieved by appending `/zarr.json` to the `path` string.

When resolving a `path` reference, implementations MUST take care to raise an error on cycles
(e.g. node A's license refers to node B and node B's license refers to node A).
